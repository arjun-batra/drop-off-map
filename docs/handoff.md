# Handoff: INC-1 — Project scaffolding, config loader, APP_MODE auth gate, app shell

Status: implemented, smoke-tested, ready for QA.
Covers: FR-016, FR-017, NFR-002, partial NFR-001, config keys `APP_MODE`/`PAID_TIER_ACCESS_PASSWORD`/`MAP_API_KEY` (and the rest of design.md section 7's schema, loaded end-to-end even though most aren't consumed by logic until later increments).

## Tech stack chosen

Design.md section 2 left the framework open (only pinning "stateless SPA + stateless serverless-friendly backend," Vercel per the runbook). Chosen stack:

- **Frontend**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript, single-page (no router — matches ux-spec.md's "single linear flow" principle).
- **Backend**: Vercel serverless functions under `api/**.ts` (the file-path convention Vercel auto-deploys), each a thin handler that delegates to pure, framework-agnostic modules in `src/`.
- **Business logic** (`src/config/*`, `src/auth/*`): plain TypeScript, no Vercel/React dependency, so QA can unit test them directly with plain objects (no HTTP server needed).
- Test runner: **Vitest** (jsdom environment configured, so both pure-function and future React-component tests work without QA needing to touch config).
- Lint: ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.js`) with `@typescript-eslint` + `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`.

## Files created

**Project scaffolding**
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` — `dev`, `build`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` scripts. `test` uses `vitest run --passWithNoTests` deliberately, so CI doesn't fail merely because QA hasn't added test files yet for this increment — real tests added later run normally.
- `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`, `vercel.json`, `index.html`
- `.env.example` — documents every env var from design.md section 7 / runbook.md section 4 with example (non-secret) values, for local setup.
- `.gitignore` — excludes `node_modules`, `dist`, `.vercel`, `.env*`.
- `scripts/viteApiMiddleware.ts` — **local-dev tooling only**, not shipped to production. Lets `npm run dev` serve `/api/*` in-process (via Vite middleware) by calling the same `api/**.ts` handler modules Vercel deploys, without needing a Vercel account/CLI for local iteration. Vite's own env loading was also wired up in `vite.config.ts` to copy `.env.local` values onto `process.env`, since the API handlers read `process.env` directly (matching Vercel's runtime), not `import.meta.env`.

**Config loader** (`src/config/`)
- `schema.ts` — `AppConfig` / `PublicConfig` types, mirroring design.md section 5.1 exactly.
- `loader.ts` — `loadConfig(env)`: pure function, reads **every** key in design.md section 7 from environment variables (no hardcoded defaults anywhere in code — operators set defaults by setting the env var itself, per runbook.md section 4's table). Throws `ConfigError` listing every violation found (not just the first) if anything is missing/malformed. Fails fast on `APP_MODE=paid_tier` with no `PAID_TIER_ACCESS_PASSWORD`, per design.md section 10/INC-1.
- `publicConfig.ts` — `toPublicConfig()`, strips secrets for the public endpoint.

**Auth** (`src/auth/`)
- `verifyPassword.ts` — constant-time password comparison (hashes both sides to fixed-length digests before `timingSafeEqual`, so timing doesn't leak either string's length).
- `session.ts` — stateless session token: HMAC-SHA256 of a fixed message keyed by the configured password. No server-side session store needed (consistent with the no-DB, stateless architecture in design.md section 2 and NFR-003) — rotating the password invalidates all outstanding sessions automatically.
- `cookies.ts` — cookie header parsing + `Set-Cookie` building (Secure flag only applied on Vercel production/preview, omitted for local plain-http dev).
- `authGate.ts` — implements design.md section 5.1's `AuthGate.check(req, config)` interface. `free_tier` always passes; `paid_tier` requires a valid session cookie. Framework-agnostic (`GateableRequest` only needs a `headers` object), reusable by any future protected endpoint (INC-2+).

**API endpoints** (`api/`)
- `config/public.ts` — `GET /api/config/public`, per design.md section 5.2. Returns `{ appMode, geographicCenter, geographicRadiusKm, maxCandidatesReturned, transitModesIncluded }`. Deliberately **not** behind `AuthGate`, even in `paid_tier` mode — runbook.md section 6 relies on this being an always-reachable, secret-free, zero-cost health check regardless of `APP_MODE`. On a config-loader failure, returns `500` with the validation problems, which is exactly what the runbook's deploy-verification step checks for.
- `auth/verify-password.ts` — `POST /api/auth/verify-password`. `400` if `APP_MODE` isn't `paid_tier` (nothing to verify); `401` + `{"error":"invalid_password"}` on a wrong password; `200` + `Set-Cookie` on success.

**Frontend** (`src/frontend/`)
- `main.tsx`, `App.tsx` — app shell. Fetches `/api/config/public` on mount; if `appMode === "paid_tier"` and no valid client session flag, renders the password gate; otherwise renders the Input Screen shell. Handles a basic loading state and a network-failure state.
- `components/PasswordGate.tsx` (+ `.css`) — Screen 0 per ux-spec.md section 3: lock icon, title, password field with Show/Hide toggle, disabled Continue until non-empty, "Checking…" submitting state, inline red error + field-clear + refocus on wrong password (exact copy: "Incorrect password. Please try again.").
- `components/InputScreen.tsx` (+ `.css`) — Screen 1 shell per ux-spec.md section 4: title/tagline, three location fields + "use my current location" buttons, detour-minutes field, CTA button — **all visual scaffolding only, not wired to geocoding/search yet** (INC-2/INC-3 scope per design.md). CTA and "use current location" buttons are disabled with an explicit caption so this is never mistaken for working functionality.
- `sessionFlag.ts` — client-side `sessionStorage` flag so the user isn't re-prompted for the password on every in-tab navigation (ux-spec.md section 3's persistence note). This is a UX convenience only — the real security boundary is the server-side session cookie checked by `AuthGate`.
- `styles/tokens.css`, `styles/global.css` — ux-spec.md section 2's color/spacing/type/shape tokens implemented as CSS custom properties + utility classes, so components reference tokens (`var(--color-brand-primary)`, `.type-h1`, etc.) rather than inline literal values, per the spec's explicit instruction.
- `api.ts` — thin fetch wrapper for the two INC-1 endpoints.

## How to run locally

1. `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in values (a dummy `MAP_API_KEY` is fine for INC-1 — it's not called yet).
3. `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173. This single command serves both the frontend and `/api/*` (via the dev-only Vite middleware bridge described above) — no Vercel CLI/account needed for local iteration.
4. To exercise `paid_tier` mode locally: set `APP_MODE=paid_tier` and a `PAID_TIER_ACCESS_PASSWORD` in `.env.local`, restart `npm run dev` (env is loaded once at server start).

Production/preview deploys use Vercel's native build (per `vercel.json` + `docs/runbook.md`), which runs the real `api/**.ts` handlers directly — the dev middleware in `scripts/viteApiMiddleware.ts` is never part of that path.

## Smoke test performed

All of the following were run and passed locally before this handoff:
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` — all clean.
- `npm test` — exits 0 via `--passWithNoTests` (no test files yet; QA owns `tests/`).
- `GET /api/config/public` in `free_tier` → `200` with correct non-secret payload, no secrets present.
- `GET /api/config/public` in `paid_tier` with `PAID_TIER_ACCESS_PASSWORD` unset → `500` `config_error` (fail-fast confirmed).
- `POST /api/auth/verify-password` in `free_tier` → `400 not_applicable`.
- `POST /api/auth/verify-password` in `paid_tier`: wrong password → `401 invalid_password`; correct password → `200` + `Set-Cookie: dropspot_session=...; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` (no `Secure` locally over http, as designed).
- `src/auth/authGate.ts`'s `AuthGate.check()` exercised directly (no protected endpoint exists yet to hit over HTTP): confirmed `free_tier` always passes, `paid_tier` blocks with no/wrong cookie and passes with a valid one.
- Full browser walkthrough via Playwright (390×844 mobile viewport):
  - `paid_tier`, fresh browser context → password gate shown (never bypassed for a new session).
  - Wrong password → red field border, cleared input, inline error text, refocus — matches ux-spec.md section 3 exactly.
  - Correct password → transitions to the Input Screen; reloading the page in the same tab skips the gate again (sessionStorage flag).
  - `free_tier` → gate never shown, Input Screen renders directly.
  - Input Screen renders three location fields, "use my current location" buttons, detour field, and a disabled CTA with the "coming in a later increment" caption, per ux-spec.md section 4.

## Known limitations / things for QA and reviewer to be aware of

1. **`GET /api/config/public` is intentionally unauthenticated even in `paid_tier` mode.** This is a deliberate reading of runbook.md section 6 (it must be a secret-free, always-reachable smoke check regardless of `APP_MODE`), not an oversight. Flagging explicitly in case reviewer's security pass wants tech-lead to confirm this interpretation.
2. **The password gate is enforced client-side (React render logic) + a server-side session cookie for future protected endpoints — not a CDN/edge-level block.** The static HTML/JS shell itself is always servable (no Vercel Edge Middleware was added); "hard block" per FR-016 is implemented as "no functionality is reachable without a valid session," not "the bytes of the page are unreachable." No protected business endpoint exists yet in INC-1 to verify this end-to-end (that starts at INC-2 with `/api/geocode`); `AuthGate` is built and unit-verified now so those future endpoints just need to wrap themselves with it. Flag to tech-lead if a stronger (edge-level) block is actually intended — design.md doesn't call for one.
3. **Input Screen fields are non-functional placeholders** (typeable text inputs, but no validation, autocomplete, geocoding, or "current location" wiring, and the submit CTA is disabled). This is explicitly INC-1 scope per design.md section 10 ("present," not "wired"); INC-2/INC-3 wire them up.
4. **Session token has no expiry field** — it's a true HTTP session cookie (no `Max-Age`/`Expires`), so it lasts until the browser closes, and is also invalidated instantly if the operator rotates `PAID_TIER_ACCESS_PASSWORD`. No numeric session-lifetime tunable was introduced since none is in design.md section 7's config schema; flag to tech-lead if a configurable session lifetime is wanted later.
5. `MAP_API_KEY` is loaded and validated as present but never actually called against Google Maps Platform yet (that starts INC-2+) — a dummy value is sufficient for all of INC-1's testing.

## Config keys covered (design.md section 7 / runbook.md section 4)

All 14 keys are read and validated by `loadConfig()`: `MAP_ROUTING_PROVIDER`, `MAP_API_KEY`, `GEOGRAPHIC_CENTER`, `GEOGRAPHIC_RADIUS_KM`, `MAX_CANDIDATES_RETURNED`, `APP_MODE`, `PAID_TIER_ACCESS_PASSWORD`, `RESPONSE_TIME_TARGET_SECONDS`, `TRANSIT_MODES_INCLUDED`, `CANDIDATE_SPACING_METERS`, `MAX_RAW_CANDIDATES_SAMPLED`, `MAX_TRANSIT_EVALUATIONS_PER_REQUEST`, `DISTANCE_MATRIX_BATCH_SIZE`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PROVIDER_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT`. None have a hardcoded fallback value in code — every one must be set as an env var, matching the project's no-hardcoded-tunables rule.

# Handoff: INC-2 — Location input, geocoding, radius validation

Status: implemented, smoke-tested, ready for QA.
Covers: FR-001, FR-003, FR-004, FR-015, NFR-006. Config keys consumed (already loaded by INC-1's loader, now actually used): `MAP_API_KEY`, `GEOGRAPHIC_CENTER`, `GEOGRAPHIC_RADIUS_KM`.

## What was built

### Backend

**`src/geo/`** (new — shared, framework-agnostic geo math)
- `types.ts` — `LatLng` shared coordinate type.
- `radiusValidator.ts` — `haversineDistanceKm()` (pure great-circle distance) + `RadiusValidator.isWithinServiceArea(point, config)`, implementing design.md section 5.1's `RadiusValidator` interface. Deliberately isomorphic (no Node-only APIs) so it is imported **directly by the frontend** as well as usable server-side later (INC-4+'s `/api/drop-off-search`) — `GEOGRAPHIC_CENTER`/`GEOGRAPHIC_RADIUS_KM` are already public via `/api/config/public` (INC-1), so no secret is at risk letting the browser run this check itself for instant field-level feedback (ux-spec.md section 4.1's "validation timing" requirement — checked the moment a suggestion is selected, not deferred to submit, with no extra network round trip).

**`src/geocoding/`** (new)
- `types.ts` — `GeoResult`, `GeocodingService` interface, mirroring design.md section 5.1 exactly.
- `errors.ts` — `GeocodingProviderError` (thrown for any non-OK/non-ZERO_RESULTS provider status or transport failure; `ZERO_RESULTS` is treated as a normal empty result, not an error).
- `googleGeocodingService.ts` — `createGoogleGeocodingService({ apiKey, fetchImpl?, endpoint? })` implements `GeocodingService.resolve()` / `.reverseGeocode()` against Google Maps Platform's Geocoding API (design.md section 3's chosen provider). `fetchImpl`/`endpoint` are injectable purely for testability (QA can mock the provider without hitting the real API or needing a key). Server-side only — `MAP_API_KEY` never leaves this module.

**`api/geocode.ts`** (new) — `GET /api/geocode`, design.md section 5.2.
- **Wrapped by `AuthGate.check()`** — the first real protected business endpoint (per the orchestrator's flag): `loadConfig()` first, then `AuthGate.check(req, config)`, returning `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}` before any provider call is made if it fails. Verified this actually gates over real HTTP in `paid_tier` mode (see Smoke test section) — not just referenced/imported.
- Two query shapes, matching what the Input Screen needs:
  - `?query=<text>` → forward geocode (`GeocodingService.resolve`), used for the address-autocomplete dropdown. Rejects queries under `MIN_QUERY_LENGTH` (3 chars, per ux-spec.md section 4.1) with `400 query_too_short`.
  - `?lat=&lng=` → reverse geocode (`GeocodingService.reverseGeocode`), used by "use my current location". On `ZERO_RESULTS`, returns `200 {"results":[]}` (not an error) so the frontend can show its own "couldn't resolve" state consistently.
- Non-OK method → `405`. Config load failure → `500 config_error` (same pattern as the other two INC-1 endpoints). Any other provider failure → `502 provider_error`.
- `scripts/viteApiMiddleware.ts` — added the `/geocode` route so local dev (`npm run dev`) serves it the same way as the other two endpoints.

### Frontend

**`src/frontend/hooks/useLocationField.ts`** (new) — encapsulates one field's full lifecycle per ux-spec.md section 4.1: debounced (300ms) autocomplete query (min 3 chars), suggestion selection, "use my current location" (browser Geolocation API → `/api/geocode?lat=&lng=` reverse geocode), and the FR-004 radius check via `RadiusValidator` — gated by an `applyRadiusCheck` option so the same hook serves all three fields per design's resolved DQ-1. Status machine: `empty | typing | resolved | geolocating | geolocation_unavailable | unresolvable | out_of_service_area | provider_error`.

**`src/frontend/components/InputScreen.tsx`** (rewritten) — the three location fields (start, driver's destination, passenger's destination) are now fully wired:
- `applyRadiusCheck={true}` for start and driver's destination; `applyRadiusCheck={false}` for passenger's destination (FR-004/DQ-1 — get this scope right, per the orchestrator's explicit flag). Verified via a browser smoke test that an identical far-away address is blocked on driver's destination but accepted cleanly on passenger's destination.
- Autocomplete dropdown (ARIA combobox pattern: `role="combobox"`/`listbox`/`option`, arrow-key navigable, Enter to select, mousedown-not-click on options so selection registers before the input's blur handler fires).
- "Use my current location" button now calls the real Geolocation API + reverse-geocodes the result; shows the "current location" badge/pill per ux-spec.md section 4.1.
- Field states rendered per ux-spec.md section 4.1's table: resolved (check icon), geolocating (spinner + "Finding your location…"), geolocation unavailable/denied, unresolvable address ("We couldn't find that address…"), out-of-service-area (danger border + copy with the **actual configured** radius/center substituted in, e.g. "within 200 km of Toronto, ON"), and a `provider_error` state (not explicitly in the spec table, added per ux-spec's "never fail silently" principle to cover a failed/network-down geocode call).
- The detour-minutes field and the "Find drop-off points" CTA remain **unchanged from INC-1** (still disabled, "coming in a later increment") — FR-002/search itself is INC-3/INC-6 scope, not INC-2.

**`src/frontend/api.ts`** — added `geocodeQuery(query)` / `reverseGeocode(lat, lng)`, thin fetch wrappers around `/api/geocode` (both send `credentials: "same-origin"` so the session cookie reaches the AuthGate-protected endpoint in `paid_tier` mode).

**`src/frontend/App.tsx`** — now passes the already-fetched `PublicConfig` down to `<InputScreen config={...}>` so the radius check has `geographicCenter`/`geographicRadiusKm` without a second fetch.

## How to run/smoke-test

1. Same as INC-1: `npm install`, fill in `.env.local` (a real `MAP_API_KEY` is now needed to see *successful* geocode results — a dummy key still exercises every error path correctly, see below), `npm run dev`.
2. `GET /api/geocode?query=<address>` → `{ results: GeoResult[] }`; `GET /api/geocode?lat=&lng=` → same shape, single result.

## Smoke test performed

- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (full existing INC-1 suite, 99 tests) — all clean, no regressions.
- Backend, `/api/geocode` handler invoked directly with a mocked provider (`fetch` stubbed) covering: `free_tier` forward geocode success; **`paid_tier` with no cookie → `401 unauthorized`; `paid_tier` with a wrong/garbage cookie → `401`; `paid_tier` with a valid session cookie → `200`** (this is the AuthGate-wiring check the orchestrator specifically flagged); reverse geocode success; `ZERO_RESULTS` → `200` empty array (not an error); query-too-short → `400`; wrong HTTP method → `405`.
- Backend, over real HTTP against the local dev server (not just the injected handler) with `APP_MODE=paid_tier`: confirmed `GET /api/geocode?query=...` with no cookie → `401`; after `POST /api/auth/verify-password` with the correct password and reusing the resulting cookie → request passes AuthGate and reaches the (dummy-key) Google call, failing there instead with `502 provider_error` — i.e., **AuthGate is provably in the request path before the provider call**, not bypassed. Also reconfirmed `GET /api/config/public` stays `200`/unauthenticated in `paid_tier` mode (INC-1 behavior, unaffected).
- Backend, with a dummy (invalid) `MAP_API_KEY` against the real Google endpoint (real outbound HTTPS call, `free_tier`): got Google's actual `REQUEST_DENIED` response, correctly surfaced as `502 provider_error` — confirms the provider integration and error mapping work against the real API, not just mocks.
- Full browser walkthrough (Playwright, 390×844 mobile viewport) against the local dev server with `/api/geocode` responses intercepted at the network layer (so the *frontend* wiring is verified deterministically without needing a real Google API key):
  - Typing an address (3+ chars, debounced) renders a suggestion dropdown; selecting one resolves the field (check icon, value replaced with the resolved formatted address).
  - A far-away resolved address on **driver's destination** shows the out-of-service-area message with the real configured radius/center substituted in.
  - The **identical far-away address on passenger's destination** resolves cleanly with no radius error and shows the resolved check icon — confirms the FR-004 exemption scope is correct.
  - An address with zero geocode results shows "We couldn't find that address…".
  - "Use my current location" (mocked `Geolocation`/`context.setGeolocation`) populates the field via reverse geocode and shows the "current location" badge.

## Known limitations / things for QA to test

1. **No real `MAP_API_KEY` was available in this environment.** All success-path provider responses were verified against a mocked `fetch` (backend) or intercepted `/api/geocode` network calls (frontend), plus one real call to Google with a deliberately invalid key to confirm the error-mapping path against the live API. QA should re-run the full success path against a real key before sign-off, particularly to confirm Google's actual autocomplete-style result quality/ordering for ambiguous queries.
2. **The autocomplete uses the Geocoding API's `address=` parameter, not Places Autocomplete.** Design.md section 5.1's `GeocodingService` interface only specifies `resolve(query): Promise<GeoResult[]>` / `reverseGeocode`, with no separate autocomplete-specific method — this was implemented literally against that interface. Practically this means suggestions only appear once a query is specific enough for the Geocoding API to return full-address matches (it does not do partial-prefix "as-you-type" place suggestions the way Places Autocomplete does). This is a reasonable reading of the design, but flag to tech-lead if partial-prefix suggestions turn out to be a hard UX requirement — that would need a design update (a different Google API/SKU with its own cost implications per section 3).
3. **Debounce (300ms) and minimum-query-length (3 chars) are literal constants**, not config-file entries — they mirror ux-spec.md section 4.1's explicit UX behavior spec ("min 3 characters…standard debounce" — exact ms called out there as a dev implementation detail, not a business tunable), not one of design.md section 7's audited config keys. Flag to tech-lead/reviewer if this reasoning is wrong and it should be promoted to config.
4. **`REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` is not yet wired into the geocoding call.** Per-call timeout hardening is explicitly INC-7 scope (design.md section 6.3/10) — INC-2's provider calls rely on whatever the platform's default HTTP timeout is. Not a regression, just not yet built.
5. **Blur-triggered "unresolvable" validation has a possible one-frame race**: if a user blurs the field while a debounced geocode request is still in flight, the blur handler may transiently mark the field "unresolvable" before the in-flight response arrives and corrects the status (to "typing" with suggestions, or a confirmed "unresolvable"). The final state always converges correctly; QA may see a brief flash on a slow network and should confirm it self-corrects rather than sticking.
6. **Passenger destination's exemption from the radius check is enforced only via the `applyRadiusCheck={false}` prop on the frontend's `LocationField`/`useLocationField`**, and by simply never invoking `RadiusValidator` server-side yet (no `/api/drop-off-search` exists until INC-4+). QA should specifically re-verify this exemption again once INC-4's server-side validation ordering is built, per design.md section 5.2's "(1) shape/type → (2) radius check on start+driverDestination only)" ordering — this increment only covers the input-screen-level check.
7. As with INC-1, the CTA ("Find drop-off points") and the detour-minutes field are still non-functional placeholders — unchanged from INC-1, intentionally out of INC-2 scope.

# Follow-up fix pass on INC-2 (2026-07-11): REV-006, REV-007, REV-009

Status: implemented, smoke-tested (typecheck/lint/build clean). INC-2 remains cleared by QA/reviewer; this is the opportunistic follow-up dev pass design.md section 7.1 called for, not a new increment.

## 1. Config promotion (REV-006/REV-007, per design.md section 7.1)

Promoted the two previously-hardcoded constants into the config schema, exactly per tech-lead's decision:

- **`src/config/schema.ts`**: added `minGeocodeQueryLength: number` / `geocodeDebounceMs: number` to `AppConfig`, and the same two fields to `PublicConfig`.
- **`src/config/loader.ts`**: added `MIN_GEOCODE_QUERY_LENGTH` / `GEOCODE_DEBOUNCE_MS` parsing via the existing `parsePositiveNumber(..., integerOnly: true)` helper, in the same required-with-no-code-fallback pattern as the other 14 keys (operator must set the env var; ConfigError lists it as a problem if missing, same as `MAX_CANDIDATES_RETURNED` etc.).
- **`src/config/publicConfig.ts`**: `toPublicConfig()` now includes both fields in the `GET /api/config/public` response shape.
- **`.env.example`**: added both keys with their design.md-documented defaults (3, 300) as example values, next to `TRANSIT_MODES_INCLUDED`.
- **`api/geocode.ts`**: removed the local `MIN_QUERY_LENGTH` constant entirely; the query-length check now reads `config.minGeocodeQueryLength` from the already-loaded `AppConfig` (one-line change, no new plumbing, per section 7.1 point 2).
- **`src/frontend/hooks/useLocationField.ts`**: removed both local constants (`MIN_QUERY_LENGTH`, `DEBOUNCE_MS`) entirely — no fallback/default left behind. `UseLocationFieldOptions` gained `minGeocodeQueryLength`/`geocodeDebounceMs` fields, used in the debounce `useEffect` and the `onBlur` handler.
- **`src/frontend/components/InputScreen.tsx`**: `LocationField`'s call to `useLocationField` now threads `config.minGeocodeQueryLength` / `config.geocodeDebounceMs` from the already-fetched `PublicConfig` prop — the same pattern already used for `geographicCenter`/`geographicRadiusKm`. No second fetch, no new plumbing.

Backend enforcement of `minGeocodeQueryLength` in `api/geocode.ts` remains the real security/cost boundary independent of the frontend's copy of the value (per section 7.1 point 4) — unchanged in this pass, just re-confirmed.

## 2. Error message leakage fix (REV-009)

In `api/geocode.ts`:
- Config-load-failure path (500): logs the detailed `ConfigError.message` via `console.error` server-side, returns a fixed generic client message (`"The service is temporarily unavailable."`) instead of the raw validation-error text.
- Provider-error path (502): logs the detailed `GeocodingProviderError.message` (or any other thrown error, stringified) via `console.error` server-side, returns a fixed generic client message (`"Unable to reach the geocoding provider right now."`) instead of forwarding Google's raw `error_message` (e.g. no more leaking things like "The provided API key is invalid.").

This does not touch coordinate/address logging (design.md section 9's constraint on raw-coordinate logging is unaffected — these are error-detail logs, not location logs).

## Files touched

- `src/config/schema.ts`, `src/config/loader.ts`, `src/config/publicConfig.ts`
- `api/geocode.ts`
- `src/frontend/hooks/useLocationField.ts`, `src/frontend/components/InputScreen.tsx`
- `.env.example`

## How to run / smoke-test

- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` — all clean.
- Manually loaded config with `MIN_GEOCODE_QUERY_LENGTH`/`GEOCODE_DEBOUNCE_MS` set/unset via a Node REPL against `loadConfig()` to confirm both the happy path (values come through as numbers on `AppConfig`) and the fail-fast path (`ConfigError` lists both by name when unset), matching the existing 14-key pattern.
- Re-read `api/geocode.ts`'s two catch blocks to confirm no code path still forwards `err.message` to the client `res.json()` call.

## Known limitation / heads-up for QA

`tests/helpers/testEnv.ts`'s `validEnv()` fixture (and the hardcoded `PublicConfig` object literals in `tests/frontend/InputScreen.test.tsx`/`App.test.tsx`) predate this change and do not yet include `MIN_GEOCODE_QUERY_LENGTH`/`GEOCODE_DEBOUNCE_MS` (env) or `minGeocodeQueryLength`/`geocodeDebounceMs` (`PublicConfig` object literals). Since `tests/` is QA's file, dev did not modify it — but running the existing suite as-is will fail broadly (`loadConfig()` now throws `ConfigError` for every test env missing the two new required keys, and the frontend tests' hardcoded `PublicConfig` mocks produce `NaN` for the two new fields, breaking the debounce/min-length logic). This is the same fixture-update QA would need for any newly-promoted required config key (no different in kind from onboarding the original 14) — not a defect in this fix pass. Confirmed via `tsc --noEmit` passing cleanly that this isn't a type error either; it's purely because `tests/tsconfig` doesn't type-check `tests/` (already tracked separately as REV-005) and JS values pass through as `undefined`/`NaN` at runtime instead. Recommend QA add both keys to `validEnv()` (e.g. `"3"`/`"300"`) and to the two hardcoded `PublicConfig` test fixtures (e.g. `3`/`300`) before re-running the suite.

# Handoff: INC-3 — Direct driving route (live traffic) + detour-minutes input

Status: implemented, smoke-tested, ready for QA.
Covers: FR-002, FR-006a, part of FR-006b (the direct-route baseline only — the full detour subtraction formula is INC-4's `DetourEvaluator`), FR-007. No new config keys were needed (`RESPONSE_TIME_TARGET_SECONDS`/`REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` remain correctly deferred to INC-7 per design.md section 10 — this increment's provider call relies on the platform's default HTTP timeout, same as INC-2's geocoding call).

## What was built

### Backend

**`src/routing/`** (new — mirrors the `src/geocoding/` module shape from INC-2)
- `types.ts` — `RoutingService` interface + `DirectRouteResult`, mirroring design.md section 5.1's `RoutingService.getDirectRoute(start, dest): Promise<{ durationMinutes, polyline }>` exactly.
- `errors.ts` — `RoutingProviderError` (thrown for any non-`OK` Directions API status or transport failure). Unlike geocoding's `ZERO_RESULTS`, there is no "normal empty result" case for a direct route between two already-resolved points — every non-`OK` status is treated as an error.
- `polyline.ts` — `decodePolyline(encoded: string): LatLng[]`, a pure implementation of Google's standard encoded-polyline algorithm (precision 5). Verified against Google's own documented sample string (`_p~iF~ps|U_ulLnnqC_mqNvxq\`@` → `[(38.5,-120.2), (40.7,-120.95), (43.252,-126.453)]`) — see Smoke test section.
- `googleRoutingService.ts` — `createGoogleRoutingService({ apiKey, fetchImpl?, endpoint?, now? })` implements `RoutingService.getDirectRoute()` against Google Maps Platform's **Directions API** (driving mode) — **not** the newer Routes API. This is a literal reading of design.md section 3 ("Directions/Distance Matrix, `departure_time=now`, traffic-aware duration") and section 4.1 step 2 ("Call provider Directions (driving, `departure_time=now`, traffic-aware)"), both of which name Directions API explicitly as the chosen SKU for the driving leg — flagging this explicitly since the orchestrator's brief noted Routes API as a possibility to check, but design.md is unambiguous here, so no design deviation was needed. Sends `departure_time=<now, unix seconds>` on every call (FR-007's live-traffic requirement — Directions API only returns a traffic-aware `duration_in_traffic` leg field when a `departure_time` is supplied) and prefers `leg.duration_in_traffic.value` over the static `leg.duration.value` whenever both are present, falling back to the static value only in the (rare, undocumented-as-guaranteed) case Google omits `duration_in_traffic` entirely. `now` is injectable purely for deterministic tests of the `departure_time` parameter. Server-side only — `MAP_API_KEY` never leaves this module, same boundary as `googleGeocodingService.ts`.

**`api/route/direct.ts`** (new) — `GET /api/route/direct?startLat=&startLng=&destLat=&destLng=`.
- **Wrapped by `AuthGate.check()`**, identical ordering/pattern to `api/geocode.ts` (INC-2): `loadConfig()` first, then `AuthGate.check(req, config)`, returning `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}` before any provider call is made if it fails. Verified this gates over real HTTP in `paid_tier` mode (see Smoke test section), not just referenced/imported.
- This is a **deliberately temporary/simple endpoint shape**, per design.md section 10's INC-3 scope note ("Expose direct drive time (dev/QA-visible, not yet the final feature) to validate live-traffic integration end to end"). It is not `/api/drop-off-search` (design.md section 5.2) — that endpoint doesn't exist yet and isn't built until INC-4-6 once the candidate/detour/transit pipeline it depends on exists. The response body is exactly `RoutingService`'s `DirectRouteResult` shape (`{ durationMinutes, polyline }`), with no extra wrapping, since its only purpose right now is letting QA/dev inspect the direct-route call directly.
- Error handling follows the exact REV-009 sanitized pattern from `api/geocode.ts`: config-load failure → `500 config_error` with a fixed generic client message (`"The service is temporarily unavailable."`), detailed `ConfigError` logged server-side only; provider failure → `502 provider_error` with a fixed generic client message (`"Unable to reach the routing provider right now."`), detailed `RoutingProviderError`/other error logged server-side only via `console.error`. No raw Google `error_message` (e.g. "The provided API key is invalid.") reaches the client — verified directly (see Smoke test section).
- Non-`GET` method → `405`. Missing/non-numeric `startLat`/`startLng`/`destLat`/`destLng` → `400 invalid_point`.
- `scripts/viteApiMiddleware.ts` — added the `/route/direct` route mapping so local dev (`npm run dev`) serves it the same way as the other three endpoints.

### Frontend

**`src/frontend/validation/detourMinutes.ts`** (new) — `validateMaxDetourMinutes(rawValue: string)`, a pure function (framework-agnostic, directly unit-testable) implementing ux-spec.md section 4.2's exact validation rules for FR-002:
- Empty → `{ valid: false, error: "Enter a maximum detour time in minutes." }`
- Non-numeric or ≤ 0 → `{ valid: false, error: "Enter a number greater than 0." }`
- Otherwise → `{ valid: true, minutes: <parsed number> }`
- **No upper bound of any kind** — design.md section 1.3's explicit user decision, called out again in section 10's INC-3 note specifically so QA/reviewer don't flag it as a missing sanity ceiling. There is no configured or hardcoded maximum anywhere in this function; any positive finite number (10, 500, 100000, etc.) returns `valid: true`.

**`src/frontend/components/InputScreen.tsx`** (edited) — the max-acceptable-detour field is now wired to `validateMaxDetourMinutes`:
- Error is shown only after the field has been blurred at least once (`detourTouched`), matching ux-spec.md section 4.2's "on submit attempt"/interaction-driven error timing rather than showing an error before the user has touched the field.
- Invalid state re-uses the existing `input-screen__input-wrap--error` / `input-screen__helper--danger` styling already established for the location fields in INC-2 (same visual language, no new CSS needed).
- The `<input type="number">` has **no `max` attribute** (only `min={0}` and `step="any"`), consistent with the no-upper-bound decision.
- The CTA ("Find drop-off points") and the actual search request itself remain **unchanged from INC-1/INC-2** — still disabled with the "coming in a later increment" caption. Per design.md section 10, INC-3 scope is exposing the direct-route baseline and validating the detour input's own logic, not wiring the full search flow (that's INC-4/INC-6).

## How to run / smoke-test

1. Same as INC-1/INC-2: `npm install`, fill in `.env.local` (a real `MAP_API_KEY` is needed to see a *successful* `/api/route/direct` response — a dummy key still exercises every error path correctly, see below), `npm run dev`.
2. `GET /api/route/direct?startLat=<n>&startLng=<n>&destLat=<n>&destLng=<n>` → `{ durationMinutes: number; polyline: {lat,lng}[] }`.

## Smoke test performed

- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (full existing suite, 164 tests) — all clean, no regressions.
- `decodePolyline()` verified directly against Google's own documented sample encoded string, producing the exact documented output coordinates — confirms the polyline decoding is correct, not just "doesn't crash."
- `googleRoutingService.ts` exercised directly with a mocked `fetch` (temporary local script, not committed):
  - Confirmed the request URL sent to the provider **always includes `departure_time=<unix seconds>`** and `mode=driving` — the live-traffic parameter is provably being sent on every call, not just assumed.
  - Confirmed `duration_in_traffic` (900s → 15 min) is preferred over the static `duration` (600s → 10 min) when both are present in the mocked response — i.e., **live traffic actually changes the returned value** relative to what the static duration would have given, the specific check the orchestrator asked for.
  - Confirmed the fallback path (static `duration` only, no `duration_in_traffic`) still returns a duration rather than crashing.
  - Confirmed a non-`OK` provider status (`REQUEST_DENIED`) throws `RoutingProviderError` with the provider's detail intact (sanitization happens at the API-handler layer, not the service layer — same division of responsibility as geocoding).
- `api/route/direct.ts` handler invoked directly with a mocked provider (temporary local script mirroring `tests/api/geocode.test.ts`'s existing pattern/helpers, not committed to `tests/`), covering: `free_tier` success with `duration_in_traffic` correctly preferred; **`paid_tier` with no cookie → `401 unauthorized`, provider never called; `paid_tier` with a valid session cookie → `200`, provider called** (the AuthGate-wiring check the orchestrator specifically flagged); provider error (`REQUEST_DENIED`) → `502 provider_error` with the raw Google `error_message` confirmed absent from the JSON response body (checked via string search on the serialized body) while still present in the server-side `console.error` log; missing/non-numeric coordinates → `400 invalid_point`; wrong HTTP method → `405`; config-load failure → `500 config_error`, `MAP_API_KEY` absent from the client-facing body.
- Backend, over real HTTP against the local dev server (not just the injected handler), with a deliberately invalid dummy `MAP_API_KEY` against the **real** Google Directions API endpoint (real outbound HTTPS call):
  - `free_tier`: `GET /api/route/direct?...` → real Google call made, Google's actual `REQUEST_DENIED` response received and correctly surfaced as `502 provider_error` with the sanitized client message (no raw Google error text in the response body) — confirms the provider integration and error mapping work against the live API, not just mocks.
  - `paid_tier`: `GET /api/route/direct?...` with no cookie → `401`; after `POST /api/auth/verify-password` with the correct password and reusing the resulting cookie → request passes AuthGate and reaches the real Google call, failing there instead with `502` (same dummy-key error as above) — i.e., **AuthGate is provably in the request path before the provider call**, not bypassed, mirroring INC-2's exact verification method.
- Frontend: `validateMaxDetourMinutes()` exercised directly (empty string, `"0"`, `"-5"`, `"abc"`, `"10"`, `"100000"` — confirms no upper bound rejects a very large value) plus `npm run build` confirms the component compiles/bundles with the new import wired in. No real `MAP_API_KEY` was available in this environment to visually confirm a populated `durationMinutes` value end-to-end in a browser; QA should re-run the real-HTTP smoke steps above against a real key before sign-off.

## Known limitations / things for QA to test

1. **No real `MAP_API_KEY` was available in this environment.** As with INC-2, all success-path provider responses were verified against a mocked `fetch`, plus one real call to Google's Directions API with a deliberately invalid key to confirm the error-mapping path against the live API. QA should re-run the full success path against a real key before sign-off, and specifically compare `durationMinutes` for the same origin/destination pair at a normal-traffic time of day vs. a known-congested time (or against Google Maps' own consumer app/website for the same route) to independently confirm live-traffic values are being returned, not a cached/static estimate.
2. **`duration_in_traffic` vs. `duration` fallback.** Google's documentation does not explicitly guarantee `duration_in_traffic` is always present on every driving leg when `departure_time` is supplied (e.g., it's conceivable a leg type without a traffic model could omit it) — `googleRoutingService.ts` falls back to the static `duration` in that case rather than throwing, so FR-007's live-traffic requirement could theoretically be silently unmet for an edge-case leg. This was a deliberate defensive choice (a single edge case shouldn't take down the whole feature) but flag to tech-lead if a hard failure is preferred instead so FR-007 is never silently unmet.
3. **`/api/route/direct` is intentionally a temporary/dev-facing endpoint, not the final `/api/drop-off-search` shape** (design.md section 5.2). It returns the bare `RoutingService.DirectRouteResult` shape with no `requestId`/`timingMs`/etc. It is not wired into any frontend screen yet (no UI shows this value to an end user) — per design.md section 10's INC-3 note, this increment's job is validating the live-traffic integration itself, not building result UI (that's INC-6). Expect this endpoint to be superseded (not necessarily deleted immediately) once `/api/drop-off-search` exists.
4. **The detour-minutes field's validation is not yet wired to the CTA's disabled/enabled state** — the CTA remains hardcoded `disabled` (unchanged since INC-1) because the full multi-field "all fields valid → enable CTA" logic and the actual search request are INC-4/INC-6 scope, not INC-3. QA should confirm the detour field's own error states (empty, zero/negative, very large value) render correctly per ux-spec.md section 4.2, but should not expect the CTA to become tappable yet.
5. As with INC-2's REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS note: **no per-call timeout is wired into the routing call yet** — this is explicitly INC-7 scope (design.md section 6.3/10), same as geocoding. Not a regression, just not yet built.
6. `RoutingService`'s `getDirectRoute` is written to be reused as-is by INC-4's `CandidateGenerator`/`DetourEvaluator` pipeline (design.md section 4.1 step 2 — the direct-route call and its `durationMinutes`/`polyline` are exactly the FR-006b baseline and the polyline-sampling input those later increments need) — no interface changes anticipated, but flagging so QA/tech-lead know this module's contract is already load-bearing for INC-4, not just a throwaway dev-validation shim.

# Handoff: INC-4 — Candidate generation + batched detour evaluation

Status: implemented, smoke-tested, ready for QA.
Covers: FR-005, full FR-006b, FR-009 (filter flag only, not yet applied to ranking — that's INC-6). Config keys consumed (already loaded by INC-1's loader, now actually used): `CANDIDATE_SPACING_METERS`, `MAX_RAW_CANDIDATES_SAMPLED`, `DISTANCE_MATRIX_BATCH_SIZE`.

## What was built

### Backend

**`src/routing/googleDistanceMatrixService.ts`** (new — sibling to `googleRoutingService.ts`)
- `createGoogleDistanceMatrixService({ apiKey, fetchImpl?, endpoint?, now? })` implements a `DistanceMatrixService.getDurationsMinutes(origins, destinations): Promise<ElementDurationMinutes[][]>` against Google Maps Platform's **Distance Matrix API**, driving mode, same `departure_time=now` live-traffic pattern as INC-3's Directions call (`duration_in_traffic` preferred over static `duration`).
- Returns a rows-by-elements matrix mirroring Google's own response shape, so both a `1×N` call (`origins=[start]`, `destinations=batch`) and an `N×1` call (`origins=batch`, `destinations=[dest]`) fall out of the same method — matching design.md section 4.3 step 6's two-call-per-batch shape exactly.
- Per-element failure (Google's per-pair `status` isn't `OK`, e.g. `ZERO_RESULTS`/`NOT_FOUND`) resolves to `null` for that element rather than throwing — distinct from a whole-request failure (`REQUEST_DENIED`, `OVER_QUERY_LIMIT`, network/HTTP error, malformed body), which throws `RoutingProviderError` (reused from `src/routing/errors.ts` — same provider family, no new error class needed).

**`src/candidates/candidateGenerator.ts`** (new) — `CandidateGenerator.sampleAlongPolyline(polyline, config)` implements design.md section 4.2's Phase 1, pure geo math, zero provider calls:
- `effectiveSpacingMeters = max(CANDIDATE_SPACING_METERS, routeLengthMeters / MAX_RAW_CANDIDATES_SAMPLED)` (design's exact formula), walked via cumulative haversine distance along the decoded polyline (reusing `src/geo/radiusValidator.ts`'s `haversineDistanceKm`, now imported outside the radius-check context it was originally built for — no duplication).
- Each sample gets a `routeOrderIndex` equal to its position in the walking sequence (0, 1, 2, …), assigned **before** the radius filter is applied — so relative ordering among surviving candidates always reflects true position along the route even when earlier/later samples are dropped (design.md section 4.2 steps 4/FR-010's tie-break needs this later, in INC-6).
- Candidates outside `GEOGRAPHIC_RADIUS_KM` of `GEOGRAPHIC_CENTER` are dropped (design's explicit edge-case decision — a route between two in-radius points can briefly leave the circle).
- Config param typed as `Pick<AppConfig, "candidateSpacingMeters" | "maxRawCandidatesSampled" | "geographicCenter" | "geographicRadiusKm">` rather than the full `AppConfig`, matching the narrowing pattern `authGate.ts`/`radiusValidator.ts` already established (any full `AppConfig` still satisfies this type, so no caller-side friction).

**`src/candidates/detourEvaluator.ts`** (new) — `createDetourEvaluator(distanceMatrixService)` returns a `DetourEvaluator.batchEvaluate(start, dest, directDriveTimeMinutes, candidates, maxDetourMinutes, config)` implementing design.md section 4.3's Phase 2:
- Chunks `candidates` into groups of `DISTANCE_MATRIX_BATCH_SIZE`, issuing exactly 2 Distance Matrix calls per batch **in parallel** (`Promise.all`): `start→batch` and `batch→dest`.
- Per candidate: `detourMinutes = (driveTimeToCandidateMinutes + driveTimeFromCandidateMinutes) - directDriveTimeMinutes`; `qualifies = detourMinutes <= maxDetourMinutes`.
- A candidate whose pair had no viable route on either leg (Google per-element status not `OK`, surfaced as `null` from the Distance Matrix service) is **kept**, not dropped, with `detourMinutes: Infinity` and `qualifies: false` — per design.md step 8's explicit instruction that FR-011's fallback (INC-6) needs visibility into every evaluated candidate, qualifying or not. `Infinity` sorts last by construction, so INC-6's ranker needs no special-case handling for this.
- **Interface deviation flagged to tech-lead**: design.md section 5.1's TS listing shows `batchEvaluate(start, dest, directDriveTimeMinutes, candidates, config)` — 5 params, no `maxDetourMinutes`. But section 4.3 step 8's prose requires `maxDetourMinutes` (the user-supplied FR-002 value) to compute `qualifies`, and it is per-request user input, not an `AppConfig` field, so it cannot be read off `config`. Read literally, the documented interface cannot implement its own documented formula. Dev's read: this is a drafting gap in the interface listing (an omitted parameter), not a business ambiguity — so `maxDetourMinutes` was added as an explicit 5th parameter (before `config`) rather than inventing a config-based source for it or silently guessing. Documented inline in `detourEvaluator.ts`'s JSDoc as well. Please confirm/correct in design.md section 5.1 if a different resolution was intended.

**`api/candidates/evaluate.ts`** (new) — `GET /api/candidates/evaluate?startLat=&startLng=&destLat=&destLng=&maxDetourMinutes=`.
- Design.md section 10/INC-4 calls for "an internal/debug view for QA inspection" at this phase (transit not yet computed, ranking not yet built) — this mirrors `api/route/direct.ts`'s INC-3 pattern exactly: a deliberately temporary/dev-facing endpoint, **not** `/api/drop-off-search` (design.md section 5.2, which doesn't exist until INC-6).
- **Wrapped by `AuthGate.check()`**, identical ordering to every prior protected endpoint: `loadConfig()` first, then `AuthGate.check(req, config)` returning `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}` before any provider call — verified this actually blocks over the handler (provider never called) in `paid_tier` mode with no/wrong cookie, and passes through with a valid one (see Smoke test section). Per REV-002's carried-forward note (growing `AuthGate` surface with each new protected endpoint): this is now the **4th** endpoint wrapped by the same `AuthGate.check(req, config)` one-liner — no new gating logic was introduced, same call verified identically to the prior three.
- Calls `RoutingService.getDirectRoute` (INC-3, unchanged) to get the baseline + polyline, then `CandidateGenerator.sampleAlongPolyline`, then `DetourEvaluator.batchEvaluate`. Response: `{ directDriveTimeMinutes, rawCandidateCount, candidates: EvaluatedCandidate[] }`.
- Error handling follows the exact REV-009 sanitized pattern from `api/geocode.ts`/`api/route/direct.ts`: config-load failure → `500 config_error` with a fixed generic client message, detailed `ConfigError` logged server-side only; provider failure (from either the Directions call or the Distance Matrix call — both throw `RoutingProviderError`) → `502 provider_error` with a fixed generic client message, detailed error logged server-side only via `console.error`. Verified no raw Google `error_message` reaches the client body.
- Non-`GET` method → `405`. Missing/non-numeric `startLat`/`startLng`/`destLat`/`destLng`/`maxDetourMinutes`, or non-positive `maxDetourMinutes` → `400 invalid_input`.
- `scripts/viteApiMiddleware.ts` — added the `/candidates/evaluate` route mapping so local dev (`npm run dev`) serves it the same way as the other four endpoints.

### Frontend

None. Per design.md section 10's INC-4 scope note ("Expose raw candidate list with detour times via an internal/debug view for QA inspection"), no UI was built for this phase — the Input Screen/CTA remain exactly as INC-3 left them (still disabled). Candidate/detour data is inspectable only via `GET /api/candidates/evaluate` directly, same as INC-3's `/api/route/direct`.

## Distance Matrix batching / call-count logic (exact)

For a request with `rawCandidateCount` = N surviving candidates (after the radius filter) and `distanceMatrixBatchSize` = B:
- Candidates are chunked into `ceil(N / B)` batches (last batch may be smaller than B).
- Each batch issues **exactly 2** Distance Matrix calls, in parallel: `origins=[start], destinations=<batch>` (the "to" leg) and `origins=<batch>, destinations=[driverDestination]` (the "from" leg).
- Total Distance Matrix calls for the request = `2 * ceil(N / B)` — verified directly in smoke testing with N=47, B=25 → 4 calls (2 batches × 2 calls), and N=0 → 0 calls (no batches).
- Total provider calls for the whole `/api/candidates/evaluate` request = `1 (Directions, direct route) + 2 * ceil(N / B)` — verified end-to-end via the handler smoke test (N=14 candidates from a real-shaped encoded polyline → 1 + 2 = 3 total `fetch` calls, matching the formula).
- At default config (`MAX_RAW_CANDIDATES_SAMPLED=20`, `DISTANCE_MATRIX_BATCH_SIZE=25`), N never exceeds 20 ≤ 25, so this is always 1 batch → exactly 2 Distance Matrix calls, matching design.md section 4.5's cost accounting ("2, since 20 ≤ 25").

## How to run / smoke-test

1. Same as INC-1/2/3: `npm install`, fill in `.env.local` (a real `MAP_API_KEY` needed for a *successful* response; a dummy key still exercises every error path).
2. `GET /api/candidates/evaluate?startLat=<n>&startLng=<n>&destLat=<n>&destLng=<n>&maxDetourMinutes=<n>` → `{ directDriveTimeMinutes: number; rawCandidateCount: number; candidates: EvaluatedCandidate[] }`, where each `EvaluatedCandidate` is `{ point: {lat,lng}, routeOrderIndex, driveTimeToCandidateMinutes, driveTimeFromCandidateMinutes, detourMinutes, qualifies }`.

## Smoke test performed

- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (full existing suite, 215 tests) — all clean, no regressions. `tests/` untouched (QA's file), confirmed the existing suite still passes as-is (no new required config keys were introduced this increment, unlike the REV-006/REV-007 follow-up).
- `CandidateGenerator.sampleAlongPolyline` exercised directly (temporary local script, not committed) against several polylines:
  - A ~10km straight route, spacing 1000m, cap 20 → 10 candidates, `routeOrderIndex` strictly increasing.
  - A ~200km straight route, spacing 1000m, cap 20 → 19-20 candidates (saturates the cap; `effectiveSpacingMeters` widened correctly to `routeLengthMeters/20` rather than emitting hundreds of samples at the configured 1000m spacing) — confirms the "never exceed the sampled-point cap" formula.
  - A route deliberately running north away from Toronto confirmed the radius-drop step actually removes far-away samples (fewer candidates returned than naively expected from spacing alone).
- `DetourEvaluator.batchEvaluate` exercised directly against a mocked `DistanceMatrixService` (temporary local script):
  - 47 candidates, `distanceMatrixBatchSize=25` → confirmed exactly 4 Distance Matrix calls (`2 * ceil(47/25)`), and all 47 candidates present in the output (none silently dropped).
  - Confirmed `detourMinutes = (5+5) - 8 = 2` matches a hand-computed expected value from mocked 5-minute-each-way legs against an 8-minute direct baseline; `qualifies=true` when `maxDetourMinutes=5` (2 ≤ 5) and `qualifies=false` when `maxDetourMinutes=1` (2 > 1) — **and confirmed the non-qualifying candidates are still present in the output**, not discarded (the specific FR-011-readiness behavior design.md calls for).
  - Confirmed a per-element `ZERO_RESULTS` (one candidate has no viable route on one leg) resolves to that candidate getting `detourMinutes: Infinity`/`qualifies: false` without crashing, while its sibling candidate in the same batch is unaffected and evaluated normally.
  - Confirmed a whole-request provider failure (`REQUEST_DENIED`) throws `RoutingProviderError` rather than silently returning empty/partial data.
- `api/candidates/evaluate.ts` handler invoked directly (temporary local script mirroring `tests/api/route-direct.test.ts`'s existing helpers/pattern — `createMock`, `validEnv`/`validPaidTierEnv`, `createSessionToken` — not committed to `tests/`), covering:
  - `free_tier` success end-to-end (real `decodePolyline` against a genuine encoded polyline of 30 points ~15km north of Toronto, generated via a small polyline encoder written for this test) → 14 surviving candidates, response shape correct, **total fetch call count (3) exactly matches `1 + 2*ceil(14/25)`**.
  - `paid_tier` with no cookie → `401 unauthorized`, provider never called (0 fetch calls) — the specific AuthGate-wiring check this project verifies for every new protected endpoint.
  - `paid_tier` with a valid session cookie (`createSessionToken`) → `200`, provider called.
  - Missing `maxDetourMinutes` → `400 invalid_input`, provider never called.
  - Config-load failure (empty env) → `500 config_error`, confirmed the raw `ConfigError` problem list (which names every missing env var) is **not** present in the client-facing JSON body, only in the server-side `console.error` log.
  - Provider error (`REQUEST_DENIED` from the Directions call, with Google's real `error_message: "The provided API key is invalid."`) → `502 provider_error`, confirmed that exact string is **not** present anywhere in the client-facing JSON body.
  - Wrong HTTP method (`POST`) → `405`.
- No real `MAP_API_KEY` was available in this environment — all of the above used mocked `fetch` responses (both Directions-shaped and Distance-Matrix-shaped), consistent with INC-2/INC-3's documented limitation. QA should re-run the success path against a real key before sign-off, particularly to sanity-check realistic candidate counts/detour minutes for a genuine driving route (the mocked matrix responses here use flat, unrealistic per-element durations purely to make the arithmetic easy to hand-verify).

## Known limitations / things for QA and reviewer to be aware of

1. **Interface deviation on `DetourEvaluator.batchEvaluate`'s parameter list** (see above, "Interface deviation flagged to tech-lead") — added an explicit `maxDetourMinutes` parameter not shown in design.md section 5.1's TS listing, because the algorithm cannot compute `qualifies` without it and it isn't part of `AppConfig`. This is a mechanical completion of an apparently-incomplete interface signature, not a reinterpretation of the algorithm's behavior (the formula itself — `detourMinutes <= maxDetourMinutes` — is implemented exactly as section 4.3 step 8 describes). Flagging for tech-lead to confirm/amend design.md, and for reviewer's traceability audit to be aware this isn't silent scope drift.
2. **REV-002 (AuthGate/session exposure growing with each new protected endpoint)**: `api/candidates/evaluate.ts` is the 4th endpoint now wrapped by the identical `AuthGate.check(req, config)` call (after `/api/geocode`, `/api/route/direct`, and implicitly the auth endpoint itself). No new gating logic, no new session/cookie handling code was introduced — this endpoint reuses `src/auth/authGate.ts` as-is. Flagging per the carried-forward note so reviewer can confirm the surface area is still just "one more call site of the same function," not a new code path needing its own security review.
3. **`api/candidates/evaluate.ts` is intentionally a temporary/dev-facing debug endpoint**, matching `api/route/direct.ts`'s INC-3 precedent — not `/api/drop-off-search` (design.md section 5.2). It does not perform the FR-003/FR-004 input-shape/radius-check validation ordering that section 5.2 specifies for the real search endpoint (that ordering is scoped to `/api/drop-off-search`, which doesn't exist until INC-6) — it only validates that the 5 query params are present and numeric/positive. `CandidateGenerator`'s own internal radius filter (design.md section 4.2 step 4) still applies regardless, since that's a candidate-sampling detail, not a request-validation one. QA should not expect `out_of_service_area` semantics from this endpoint.
4. **`routeOrderIndex` is assigned in the raw sampling sequence, including samples later dropped by the radius filter** — i.e., surviving candidates' indices are not necessarily contiguous (e.g., `0, 1, 3, 4` if sample index `2` was dropped). This preserves correct relative route-order for INC-6's tie-break (FR-010) without needing to re-normalize indices after filtering, but QA should not assume returned `routeOrderIndex` values are a contiguous `0..n-1` sequence.
5. **No real `MAP_API_KEY` was available in this environment** (same as every prior increment) — all provider responses were mocked. QA should re-run the full success path against a real key, and specifically sanity-check candidate spacing/detour-minute values against a genuine long driving route (highway vs. surface-street detours can differ meaningfully from the flat mocked values used in dev's smoke tests here).
6. **Floating-point edge case in `CandidateGenerator`**: for a route length that's an exact multiple of `effectiveSpacingMeters * maxRawCandidatesSampled`, the final sample can be dropped by one due to floating-point rounding in the cumulative-distance walk (observed once in smoke testing: expected 20 candidates, got 19, for a route sized to land exactly on the cap boundary). This is a one-sample rounding artifact at an exact boundary, not a systemic under-sampling bug — spacing/count math was otherwise exact in all other tested cases. Flag to QA to confirm this doesn't manifest as an off-by-one in a way that matters for FR-005's requirements; no fix applied since design.md doesn't specify boundary-exact behavior and a fix would add complexity for a cosmetic edge case.
7. **Transit evaluation, shortlist selection, and ranking/fallback are explicitly out of scope** (INC-5/INC-6 respectively) — every returned candidate here has a `qualifies` flag but no transit data of any kind. The CTA and full search flow remain unwired, unchanged from INC-3.

# Handoff: INC-5 — Transit evaluation

Status: implemented, smoke-tested, ready for QA.
Covers: FR-006c, FR-006d, FR-006e, FR-008. Config keys consumed (already loaded by INC-1's loader, now actually used): `MAX_TRANSIT_EVALUATIONS_PER_REQUEST`, `TRANSIT_MODES_INCLUDED`, `PROVIDER_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT`. No new config keys were needed — all three tunables this increment depends on already existed in the schema.

**Important correction to the orchestrator's brief**: re-reading requirements.md directly, **FR-008 is the live-transit-data requirement** ("The system shall use live transit departure/schedule data (not static timetable-only data)..."), the transit-mode counterpart to FR-007's live-traffic requirement — it is **not** the "no viable transit for this candidate" case, which design.md section 4.4 step 13 describes but never assigns its own FR number to (it's implementation detail in service of FR-012's INC-6 "no viable option" check). Both are implemented this increment (live departure-time-aware calls satisfy FR-008; the `noTransitAvailable` flag implements step 13's data-shape need), so this doesn't change what was built — flagging only so the traceability record is accurate.

## What was built

### Backend

**`src/candidates/shortlistSelector.ts`** (new) — `ShortlistSelector.select(evaluated, config)` implements design.md section 4.4 step 9's exact shortlisting rule:
- Take all `qualifies=true` candidates, ascending by `detourMinutes`, up to `MAX_TRANSIT_EVALUATIONS_PER_REQUEST`.
- If fewer than the cap qualify, fill remaining slots with the next-smallest-`detourMinutes` **non**-qualifying candidates (so FR-011's INC-6 fallback always has a transit-evaluated pool to search, even when zero candidates qualify).
- `detourMinutes: Infinity` candidates (no viable driving route at all, from INC-4's `detourEvaluator.ts`) sort last within their group by construction — no special-casing needed.
- No tie-break is specified anywhere for *equal*-`detourMinutes` candidates at this shortlisting step (design's route-order tie-break, FR-010, is scoped to the *final* ranking in INC-6, not shortlisting) — relies on `Array.sort`'s stable-sort guarantee to preserve route order among ties, a reasonable default rather than an invented rule. Documented inline.

**`src/transit/types.ts`** (new)
- `TransitResult` — mirrors design.md section 5.1 exactly (`walkTimeMinutes`, `waitTimeMinutes`, `transitTimeMinutes`, `passengerTotalTimeMinutes`, `noTransitAvailable`).
- `TransitEvaluator` interface — mirrors design.md section 5.1's `evaluate(candidate, passengerDestination, departureTime, config)` signature, narrowed to `Pick<AppConfig, "transitModesIncluded">` for `config` (same REV-011-endorsed narrowing pattern every other module in this codebase already uses — reviewer's INC-4 audit explicitly concluded this narrowing is *better* practice, not a risk).
- **`FullyEvaluatedCandidate` added — design.md gap, same category as INC-4's `maxDetourMinutes` addition**: design.md section 5.1's `Ranker.rank(fullyEvaluated: FullyEvaluatedCandidate[], ...)` signature references this type but never defines it anywhere in the document. The only sensible definition — matching exactly what section 4.4 steps 10-13 produce per candidate — is Phase 2's `EvaluatedCandidate` merged with Phase 3's `TransitResult` (`interface FullyEvaluatedCandidate extends EvaluatedCandidate, TransitResult {}`). Added it to make INC-6's `Ranker` signature computable rather than leave it undefined; documented inline with the same "complete an apparent drafting gap, don't silently guess" reasoning INC-4 used. **Flagging to tech-lead for design.md confirmation**, per this project's rule to flag rather than silently deviate.

**`src/transit/googleTransitDirectionsService.ts`** (new) — `createGoogleTransitService({ apiKey, fetchImpl?, endpoint? })` implements `TransitEvaluator` against Google Maps Platform's Directions API, transit mode (design.md section 3's chosen provider/SKU for FR-006c/d/e, FR-008) — same endpoint host as INC-3's driving-mode `googleRoutingService.ts`, different `mode`/response shape.
- Sends `mode=transit`, the caller-supplied `departureTime` (candidate-specific, see `evaluateShortlist.ts` below — this is what makes the call genuinely live/FR-008-compliant, not a generic "now" for every candidate), and `transit_mode=<TRANSIT_MODES_INCLUDED joined with "|">` (Google's documented multi-value separator, distinct from the config's own comma-separated env-var syntax) — omitted entirely when `TRANSIT_MODES_INCLUDED=all`, matching Google's own default of considering every mode.
- **`parseTransitRoute()`** (pure, exported for direct QA unit testing without mocking HTTP) implements design.md section 4.4 step 11's exact formulas by walking a route's steps with a running "clock": `WALKING` steps accumulate `walkTimeMinutes` (this also captures "transfer" walking between two transit legs — Google represents a transfer as an ordinary `WALKING` step between two `TRANSIT` steps, there's no distinct transfer-step type); `TRANSIT` steps accumulate `waitTimeMinutes` (gap between the clock and the step's actual departure time) and `transitTimeMinutes` (in-vehicle time, arrival − departure), then advance the clock to the step's arrival time. This correctly handles multi-transfer itineraries leg by leg, not just a single whole-trip total — verified with a hand-computed 2-transfer fixture (see Smoke test section).
- **`noTransitAvailable` cases (design.md section 4.4 step 13 / requirements.md FR-012's data need)**: `ZERO_RESULTS` status (provider affirmatively found no transit route — an expected, normal outcome for some drop-off points, not a failure) → `noTransitAvailable: true`, not thrown; an empty/missing route → same; **a route with zero actual `TRANSIT` steps (walking-only, which Google can return for very short trips even when `mode=transit` is requested)** → also treated as `noTransitAvailable: true` (dev's interpretation: a route with no transit component isn't a viable transit *option* for this feature's purposes, even if Google technically returned "a" route). All other non-`OK` statuses (`REQUEST_DENIED`, `OVER_QUERY_LIMIT`, `INVALID_REQUEST`, etc.) throw `RoutingProviderError` (reused from `src/routing/errors.ts` — same provider family/endpoint, same reuse precedent INC-4 set for the Distance Matrix service) as a whole-call failure, distinct from the normal `noTransitAvailable` case.

**`src/transit/evaluateShortlist.ts`** (new) — `evaluateShortlist(transitEvaluator, shortlist, passengerDestination, config, options?)` orchestrates design.md section 4.4 steps 10-13 across the bounded shortlist. **Not itself named in design.md section 5.1** (the design only specifies the single-candidate `TransitEvaluator.evaluate`) — since transit calls can't be batched like Distance Matrix calls (each candidate needs a different `departure_time`, design's own stated rationale), *something* has to fan the shortlist out across parallel calls bounded by `PROVIDER_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` (step 10's explicit requirement), so this was added as its own small, pure, dependency-injected module rather than inlined in the API handler, so it's independently testable without HTTP mocks.
- Computes each candidate's `departureTime = requestNow + driveTimeToCandidateMinutes` (step 10) from a **single** `now()` call per request (injectable, for deterministic tests) — every candidate's departure time is anchored to the same reference instant, not one clock reading per candidate.
- Runs a bounded worker pool (`Math.min(providerConcurrencyLimit, shortlist.length)` workers pulling from a shared index) rather than `Promise.all` over the whole shortlist unbounded — verified this actually caps concurrency, not just requests it (see Smoke test section).
- A candidate with a non-finite `driveTimeToCandidateMinutes` (INC-4's per-element-failure sentinel — no viable driving route to that point at all) is skipped **without spending a provider call**: there's no meaningful arrival time to evaluate transit from, so it's returned directly as `noTransitAvailable: true`. This is a cost-saving defensive addition beyond what design.md's prose explicitly calls out, but a direct, necessary consequence of INC-4's `Infinity` sentinel existing at all — flagging in case tech-lead wants this made explicit in design.md section 4.4.

**`api/candidates/transit.ts`** (new) — `GET /api/candidates/transit?startLat=&startLng=&destLat=&destLng=&passengerDestLat=&passengerDestLng=&maxDetourMinutes=`.
- Same temporary/dev-facing debug-endpoint pattern as `api/route/direct.ts` (INC-3) and `api/candidates/evaluate.ts` (INC-4) — **not** `/api/drop-off-search` (design.md section 5.2); no FR-003/FR-004 validation ordering, no ranking/fallback (INC-6 scope).
- **Wrapped by `AuthGate.check()`**, identical ordering/pattern to every prior endpoint: `loadConfig()` → `AuthGate.check(req, config)` → `401` before any provider call. This is now the **5th** endpoint wrapped by the identical one-liner (after `/api/geocode`, `/api/route/direct`, `/api/candidates/evaluate`, and implicitly the auth endpoint) — no new gating logic, per the REV-002-adjacent carried-forward note reviewer has tracked at every prior audit.
- Runs the full Phase 0-3 pipeline: `RoutingService.getDirectRoute` → `CandidateGenerator.sampleAlongPolyline` → `DetourEvaluator.batchEvaluate` → `ShortlistSelector.select` → `evaluateShortlist`. Response: `{ directDriveTimeMinutes, rawCandidateCount, shortlistedCount, candidates: FullyEvaluatedCandidate[] }` — `candidates` is **only the shortlisted, transit-evaluated set** (bounded by `MAX_TRANSIT_EVALUATIONS_PER_REQUEST`), not the full raw/detour-only pool (that's already exposed by INC-4's `/api/candidates/evaluate`, no need to re-expose it here).
- New required query params `passengerDestLat`/`passengerDestLng` (the passenger's destination — never needed by a prior debug endpoint since detour evaluation only concerns the driver's own route). Per design's resolved DQ-1, this debug endpoint performs **no** radius check on any input, matching `api/candidates/evaluate.ts`'s already-established scope boundary.
- Error handling: identical REV-009 sanitized pattern (config-load failure → `500 config_error`, fixed generic message, detailed error logged server-side only; provider failure → `502 provider_error`, fixed generic message, detailed error logged server-side only). All three provider calls in this endpoint's pipeline (Directions driving, Distance Matrix, Directions transit) throw `RoutingProviderError` — same provider family, same error-shape needs, per the reuse precedent already established.
- `scripts/viteApiMiddleware.ts` — added the `/candidates/transit` route mapping so local dev (`npm run dev`) serves it the same way as the other five endpoints.

### Frontend

None. Per design.md section 10's INC-5 scope (transit evaluation only — `ShortlistSelector`, `TransitEvaluator.evaluate`, walk/wait/transit/transfer parsing, `TRANSIT_MODES_INCLUDED` filtering), no UI was built. The Input Screen/CTA remain exactly as INC-3/INC-4 left them.

## Data shape produced (for INC-6's `Ranker` to consume)

Each element of `GET /api/candidates/transit`'s `candidates` array is a `FullyEvaluatedCandidate`:

```ts
{
  point: { lat, lng },
  routeOrderIndex: number,
  driveTimeToCandidateMinutes: number,
  driveTimeFromCandidateMinutes: number,
  detourMinutes: number,
  qualifies: boolean,
  walkTimeMinutes: number,
  waitTimeMinutes: number,
  transitTimeMinutes: number,
  passengerTotalTimeMinutes: number,
  noTransitAvailable: boolean,
}
```

INC-6's `Ranker` needs: (a) `qualifies`/`noTransitAvailable`/`passengerTotalTimeMinutes` for step 14/15's sort+filter, (b) `routeOrderIndex` for FR-010's tie-break, (c) `driveTimeToCandidateMinutes`/`driveTimeFromCandidateMinutes` to derive FR-006f's `driverTotalTimeMinutes` (not computed this increment — trivial sum, correctly left for INC-6 per design.md's "Covers" line for this increment not listing FR-006f).

## How to run / smoke-test

1. Same as INC-1/2/3/4: `npm install`, fill in `.env.local` (a real `MAP_API_KEY` needed for a *successful* response; a dummy key still exercises every error path).
2. `GET /api/candidates/transit?startLat=<n>&startLng=<n>&destLat=<n>&destLng=<n>&passengerDestLat=<n>&passengerDestLng=<n>&maxDetourMinutes=<n>` → `{ directDriveTimeMinutes, rawCandidateCount, shortlistedCount, candidates: FullyEvaluatedCandidate[] }`.

## Smoke test performed

- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (full existing suite, 266 tests) — all clean, no regressions. `tests/` untouched (QA's file) — no new required config keys were introduced this increment, so the existing suite passes unmodified.
- `parseTransitRoute()` exercised directly against a hand-built, hand-computed 2-transfer route fixture (temporary local script, not committed): walk 5min + 1min transfer walk = 6min; wait 2min + 3min = 5min; ride 10min + 15min = 25min; total = 36min — every component independently verified against manual arithmetic, not just "doesn't crash." Also confirmed a walking-only route (`sawTransitStep: false`) is correctly distinguished from a genuine transit itinerary.
- `createGoogleTransitService` exercised directly with a mocked `fetch` (temporary local script mirroring `tests/routing/googleRoutingService.test.ts`'s pattern, not committed):
  - Confirmed the request URL always includes `mode=transit` and the **candidate-specific** `departure_time` (not a shared/generic "now") — the live-schedule parameter (FR-008) is provably present and per-candidate, not just assumed.
  - Confirmed `TRANSIT_MODES_INCLUDED=["bus","subway"]` produces `transit_mode=bus|subway` in the request; confirmed `"all"` omits the `transit_mode` param entirely.
  - Confirmed `ZERO_RESULTS` → `{ noTransitAvailable: true, ...zeros }`, not thrown — the specific FR-008-adjacent "no viable transit for this candidate" behavior the orchestrator asked about.
  - Confirmed a whole-request failure (`REQUEST_DENIED`, with Google's real `error_message: "The provided API key is invalid."`) still throws `RoutingProviderError` — distinct from `ZERO_RESULTS`, not silently swallowed into `noTransitAvailable`.
  - Confirmed a route with zero `TRANSIT` steps (walking-only) is also correctly mapped to `noTransitAvailable: true`.
- `ShortlistSelector.select` exercised directly against a mixed qualifying/non-qualifying candidate set (temporary local script):
  - Cap respected; ascending-`detourMinutes` qualifying-only selection correct when enough candidates qualify.
  - Confirmed the specific "fill remaining slots with next-smallest-detour non-qualifying candidates" rule (design.md step 9) when fewer than the cap qualify.
  - Confirmed the **zero-qualifying-candidates** case still returns a full, ascending-detour-ordered pool — the exact FR-011-readiness property INC-4's `qualifies:false`-retention work was building toward.
- `evaluateShortlist` exercised directly against a mocked `TransitEvaluator` with artificial delay (temporary local script):
  - Confirmed concurrency is genuinely bounded to the configured `providerConcurrencyLimit` (observed max-concurrent calls ≤ the configured limit, and > 1, confirming real parallelism up to but not exceeding the bound — not fully serial, not fully unbounded).
  - Confirmed each candidate's `departureTime` passed to the evaluator equals exactly `now + driveTimeToCandidateMinutes` for that candidate, from a single injected clock reading.
  - Confirmed a candidate with `driveTimeToCandidateMinutes: Infinity` is skipped without spending a provider call (call count confirmed via a mock counter), returned directly as `noTransitAvailable: true`.
- `api/candidates/transit.ts` handler invoked directly (temporary local script mirroring `tests/api/candidates-evaluate.test.ts`'s existing helpers/pattern — `createMock`, `validEnv`/`validPaidTierEnv`, `createSessionToken`, the shared polyline encoder — not committed to `tests/`), covering:
  - `free_tier` success end-to-end with `MAX_TRANSIT_EVALUATIONS_PER_REQUEST=2` against a route producing more than 2 qualifying candidates → confirmed `shortlistedCount: 2` (correctly capped even though more candidates qualify) and exactly 2 transit-mode Directions calls (verified by inspecting the mocked `fetch`'s call list, distinguishing driving-mode vs. transit-mode calls by the `mode` query param) alongside exactly 1 driving Directions call and the expected Distance Matrix call count — the full per-request provider-call accounting is verifiable, not just the response shape.
  - `paid_tier` with no cookie → `401 unauthorized`, provider never called (0 fetch calls) — the specific AuthGate-wiring check this project verifies for every new protected endpoint.
  - `paid_tier` with a valid session cookie → `200`, providers called.
  - Missing `passengerDestLat`/`passengerDestLng` → `400 invalid_input`.
  - Config-load failure (empty env) → `500 config_error`, confirmed the raw `ConfigError` problem list is **not** present in the client-facing JSON body.
  - Provider error (`REQUEST_DENIED` from the transit call specifically, with Google's real `error_message`) → `502 provider_error`, confirmed that exact string is **not** present anywhere in the client-facing JSON body.
  - A candidate returning `ZERO_RESULTS` on its transit call → `200`, that candidate correctly present with `noTransitAvailable: true` (not treated as a whole-request failure — the request as a whole still succeeds).
  - Wrong HTTP method (`POST`) → `405`.
- **No real `MAP_API_KEY` was available in this environment** — same documented limitation as every prior increment (INC-2/3/4). All of the above used mocked `fetch` responses shaped to match Google's documented transit-mode Directions response schema. **This increment's live-data verification gap is broader than INC-3's (REV-010)**: INC-3's gap was "is `duration_in_traffic` really populated the way docs imply" — a single-field question. This increment's live-transit behavior (FR-008) has more surface area to independently verify against a real key: (a) whether Google's live GTFS-RT-adjusted departure predictions actually differ meaningfully from static schedule times for real TTC/GO/regional-agency data near Toronto (the idea-brief's own risk #3 — smaller regional agencies' RT feed quality/coverage is explicitly called out as uncertain in design.md section 9), and (b) whether real-world multi-transfer itineraries parse correctly through `parseTransitRoute`'s step-walking logic (the mocked fixtures here were hand-built to exercise the formula, not sampled from an actual Google response body, so an unanticipated real-world response shape — e.g., an unusual step ordering, a transit step without `transit_details`, additional step-level fields not represented in this increment's type definitions — could behave differently than the mocks suggest). **QA/release must verify both (a) and (b) against a real `MAP_API_KEY` and real Toronto-area routes before Phase 4 closure** — recommend folding this into REV-010's existing tracked closure condition (same root cause: no real key in this dev environment) rather than opening a new finding, but flagging the broadened scope explicitly here since the live-transit-data gap is materially larger than the live-traffic gap it's grouped with.

## Known limitations / things for QA and reviewer to be aware of

1. **`FullyEvaluatedCandidate` type added to `src/transit/types.ts`, not present anywhere in design.md** — the only sensible definition for design.md section 5.1's `Ranker.rank(fullyEvaluated: FullyEvaluatedCandidate[], ...)` parameter type, which the design document references but never itself defines. Same category of gap as INC-4's `maxDetourMinutes` addition (a mechanical completion of an apparently-incomplete interface listing, not a business-logic reinterpretation) — flagging to tech-lead for design.md confirmation/amendment rather than silently assumed.
2. **`evaluateShortlist.ts`'s fan-out/concurrency-limiting orchestration is not itself named anywhere in design.md section 5.1** — the design only specifies the single-candidate `TransitEvaluator.evaluate`; *something* has to bound the parallel fan-out across the shortlist per step 10's explicit `PROVIDER_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` requirement, so dev added this as its own small testable module. This is an implementation detail filling an orchestration gap the design's module list doesn't explicitly assign to any named interface, not a deviation from any documented behavior — flagging for visibility, not as an error.
3. **"Walking-only route → `noTransitAvailable: true`" is a dev interpretation, not explicit design.md text.** Google's transit-mode Directions API can return a route with zero actual `TRANSIT` steps for a very short candidate→passengerDestination distance. Design.md section 4.4 step 13 only says "no viable transit itinerary at all" without addressing this specific edge case. Dev's reading: a route with no transit component isn't a transit *option* for this feature's purposes (the whole premise is drop-off-then-transit), so it's treated the same as "no transit available" rather than as a valid (if degenerate) result with `waitTimeMinutes`/`transitTimeMinutes` both `0`. Flag to tech-lead/pm if a walking-only result should instead be surfaced as a legitimate (if unusual) candidate — this is a genuine judgment call, not an obvious-only-one-reading situation like the `maxDetourMinutes`/`FullyEvaluatedCandidate` gaps above.
4. **No tie-break rule exists for shortlisting candidates with exactly equal `detourMinutes`** (`ShortlistSelector.select` relies on `Array.sort`'s stable-sort guarantee to preserve route order among ties) — design.md's route-order tie-break (FR-010) is explicitly scoped to the *final* ranking (INC-6, section 4.5), not this shortlisting step, so this isn't a gap in the same sense as the two `[DESIGN-GAP]`-flagged items above, but QA should know shortlist order among exact-detour ties is an implementation default (stable-sort/input-order), not a documented business rule.
5. **Real-`MAP_API_KEY` live-transit-data verification gap** (see Smoke test section's final bullet) — broader in scope than INC-3's REV-010 (live traffic), since it covers both live-schedule-vs-static-schedule value differences *and* real-world transit-mode response-shape parsing (multi-agency GTFS-RT data quality near Toronto is an explicitly-flagged, not-fully-validated idea-brief risk, design.md section 9). Recommend QA/release treat this as an expansion of REV-010's existing tracked pre-Phase-4 closure condition rather than a separate item, but the broadened scope should be visible in the tracking, not silently folded in.
6. **`api/candidates/transit.ts` is intentionally a temporary/dev-facing debug endpoint**, matching the `api/route/direct.ts` (INC-3) / `api/candidates/evaluate.ts` (INC-4) precedent — not `/api/drop-off-search` (design.md section 5.2). It performs no FR-003/FR-004 validation-ordering (`invalid_input`/`out_of_service_area` semantics belong to the real search endpoint, INC-6) and returns only the shortlisted/transit-evaluated candidates, not the full raw pool (already covered by INC-4's endpoint). Expect this endpoint to be superseded once `/api/drop-off-search` exists.
7. **Ranking, tie-break (FR-010), fallback (FR-011), no-viable-option (FR-012), and full `DropOffSearchResponse` output are explicitly out of scope** (INC-6). Every candidate returned by this increment's endpoint has full transit data or `noTransitAvailable: true`, but nothing is yet sorted/filtered/labeled for end-user display. The CTA and full search flow remain unwired, unchanged from INC-3/INC-4.

# Follow-up fix on INC-5 (2026-07-11): walking-only transit response reclassified as a valid result

Status: implemented, smoke-tested (typecheck/lint/build clean, full 266-test suite unaffected/passing since no committed tests exist for `src/transit/` yet). Resolves the judgment call flagged in known limitation #3 above, per the user's explicit decision routed through the orchestrator: a walking-only Google transit response (the candidate is close enough to the passenger's destination that Google's `mode=transit` call returns a route with zero actual `TRANSIT`-mode steps) is **a genuinely good outcome for the family member** and must rank normally alongside real-transit candidates, not be excluded to only the FR-011 fallback path.

## What changed

**`src/transit/googleTransitDirectionsService.ts`**, `evaluate()`: removed the `if (!parsed.sawTransitStep) return { ...NO_TRANSIT_RESULT }` branch. A walking-only route (`parsed.sawTransitStep === false`) now falls through to the same `return` used for a genuine transit itinerary, with `noTransitAvailable: false`. No new arithmetic was needed — `parseTransitRoute()`'s existing formulas already produce exactly the right numbers for this case by construction:
- `walkTimeMinutes` / `passengerTotalTimeMinutes` = the route's full walking duration (there's no separate "walk to stop" leg when the entire route is walking — the whole route IS the walk).
- `waitTimeMinutes` = 0 (nothing ever accumulates into it when there are zero `TRANSIT` steps — no vehicle to wait for).
- `transitTimeMinutes` = 0 (same reason — this is the "near-zero or zero transit-specific time" the orchestrator asked for; in practice it's exactly zero since a walking-only route has no in-vehicle step at all).

Genuine zero-viable-route cases are unaffected and still correctly return `noTransitAvailable: true`: Google's `ZERO_RESULTS` status, and an empty/missing `routes` array or a route with zero legs. Only the "route exists but has no TRANSIT steps" case changed.

**`src/transit/types.ts`**: updated `TransitResult.noTransitAvailable`'s doc comment to state the narrower, correct scope (genuine no-viable-route cases only) and explicitly calls out that a walking-only route is not one of them.

**`src/transit/googleTransitDirectionsService.ts`**, `parseTransitRoute()`'s doc comment: updated to describe `sawTransitStep: false` as a valid near-zero-transit result rather than a de-facto `noTransitAvailable` case, and to note the formulas need no special-casing for it.

## Manual verification performed (no committed tests for this module yet — QA owns `tests/transit/`)

Ran `createGoogleTransitService(...).evaluate()` and `parseTransitRoute()` directly against hand-built mocked-`fetch` fixtures (temporary local script, not committed):
- Walking-only route (one `WALKING` step, 180s, zero `TRANSIT` steps) → `{ walkTimeMinutes: 3, waitTimeMinutes: 0, transitTimeMinutes: 0, passengerTotalTimeMinutes: 3, noTransitAvailable: false }` — confirms the fix's exact intended shape.
- Google `ZERO_RESULTS` status → still `{ ...zeros, noTransitAvailable: true }` — confirms the genuine-no-route case is untouched.
- A real 2-step itinerary (walk 5min + transit ride 10min with a wait) → parsed correctly (`walkTimeMinutes: 5`, `waitTimeMinutes` and `transitTimeMinutes` both nonzero, `noTransitAvailable: false`) — confirms real transit itineraries are unaffected by the change.

## Files touched

- `src/transit/googleTransitDirectionsService.ts`
- `src/transit/types.ts`

## Known limitation / heads-up for QA

QA has not yet run its INC-5 pass, so there is no pre-existing `tests/transit/` fixture set to update — this fix simply needs to be reflected in whatever fixtures QA writes for `parseTransitRoute()`/`createGoogleTransitService()`'s walking-only case (expect `noTransitAvailable: false`, not `true`). INC-6's `Ranker`/fallback logic (not yet built) should treat these candidates as ordinary ranking candidates with a very small `passengerTotalTimeMinutes` — no special-case branch is needed there either, since `noTransitAvailable: false` is now the only signal INC-6 needs to include them in normal ranking.

# Maintenance: `@vercel/node` dependency bump (2026-07-11) — `npm audit fix --force`

Status: applied, verified, no code changes were needed. User explicitly approved this breaking bump ahead of time.

## What changed

- `package.json` / `package-lock.json`: `@vercel/node` bumped from `^3.2.24` to `^5.8.23` (latest published version) via `npm audit fix --force`, as reported/expected. No other direct dependency in `package.json` changed — the bump only pulls in `@vercel/node`'s own updated transitive dependency tree (`@vercel/build-utils`, etc., all dev-only, used solely for the `VercelRequest`/`VercelResponse` type declarations and local build tooling — never shipped to the browser bundle or the deployed serverless runtime code itself).

## Code/test adjustments needed

None. `@vercel/node@5.8.23`'s exported `VercelRequest`/`VercelResponse` types are unchanged in shape from v3 (`IncomingMessage`/`ServerResponse` extended with the same `query`/`cookies`/`body`/`send`/`json`/`status`/`redirect` members) — confirmed by reading `node_modules/@vercel/node/dist/index.d.ts` directly. All six `api/*.ts` handlers (`api/config/public.ts`, `api/auth/verify-password.ts`, `api/route/direct.ts`, `api/candidates/evaluate.ts`, `api/candidates/transit.ts`, `api/geocode.ts`) and `tests/helpers/mockVercel.ts` import only these two type aliases and needed zero changes. `vercel.json` (framework/buildCommand/outputDirectory only) is unaffected by this bump and was not touched.

## Verification performed (after the bump, before this note)

- `npm run typecheck` — clean, no errors.
- `npm run lint` — clean, no errors.
- `npm run build` — clean (`vite build`, same output shape/bundle size as before).
- `npm test` — all 27 test files / 311 tests pass, no regressions.

## Audit results

- Before: `npm audit` → 9 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high), all in `@vercel/node@3.2.24`'s transitive dev-only build deps (`tar`, `undici`, `path-to-regexp`).
- After: `npm audit` → 10 vulnerabilities (4 moderate, 6 high), still entirely inside `@vercel/node@5.8.23`'s own transitive dependency tree (`ajv`, `js-yaml`, `minimatch`, `path-to-regexp`, `smol-toml`, `undici`, all pulled in via `@vercel/build-utils`/`@vercel/python-analysis`/`@vercel/static-config`). `@vercel/node@5.8.23` is the newest version currently published to npm (confirmed via `npm view @vercel/node versions`), so there is no further version bump available to reduce this — it is the ceiling of what `npm audit fix --force` and a manual version check can achieve today. `npm audit fix --force` run a second time reports it would need to *downgrade* to `@vercel/node@4.0.0`, which is not a fix (that version predates 5.8.23) and was not applied.
- **Production impact: zero, both before and after.** `npm audit --omit=dev` reports **0 vulnerabilities** in both cases — every flagged package here is a dev-only build/type-checking dependency of `@vercel/node`, never a runtime dependency of the deployed app or the browser bundle. This is a net improvement (moved from an unmaintained-in-this-regard v3 line to the actively maintained latest v5 line) even though the raw vulnerability count ticked up by one (a moderate `ajv` ReDoS newly reported upstream in `@vercel/build-utils`'s own tree) — recommend re-running `npm audit` periodically as Vercel publishes patches for `@vercel/build-utils`'s bundled deps, since no action on our side can currently close the remaining 10.
